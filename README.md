**Udacity Viz D3 Mini-Project 2**:

1. Using the suggested link WTF Visualizations (http://wtfviz.net/), I chose a study in June 2016 of the world population from the World Economic Forum (http://wef.ch/1ZDBYYU). China and India already have well over 1 billion people each. But while China’s population is forecast to level out in the 2020s at around 1.4 billion. By 2022, India’s population will have overtaken China’s to become the largest in the world, according to a United Nations report (http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/publications/files/key_findings_wpp_2015.pdf). The chart from the study shown India's population is set to be bigger than China's and the economic implications are huge.

2. The original chart type was created using clustered columns (see image here http://wef.ch/1ZDBYYU). While the chart shown India and China projected population, but it does not appeared is the most easy, straight forward fashion for the audience.

3. A more visually effective can be a simple line chart type via dimple.js. Eliminate the clustered columns which aren't adding informative value to our visuals. With the line chart between the projected populations of India and China. Doing so causes our data to just stand out more as it can be clearly depicted with the intersection of the chart which shown by year 2022 when India’s population will have overtaken China’s to become the largest in the world.

4. To draw our audience's attention to where we want them to pay attention here next by using Bubble Lines where the population is size of the bubbles.  

5. The original article provided time series of 2015, 2030, 2050, to year 2100.  To narrow down the time period of interest between 2015 to 2030, the population data tsv was extrapolated via the United States Census Bureau website here: http://www.census.gov/population/international/data/idb/informationGateway.php.
